# RAG-with-Ollama-and-ChromaDB
---
This project aims at building a chatbot that leverages a ***Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)*** system to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses. By integrating ***Ollama*** with open-source language models and a retrieval system using ***ChromaDB***, the chatbot can access and utilize a knowledge base without relying on proprietary *APIs* or *keys*.

## Key Features:

- ***Open-Source Stack***: Utilizes entirely open-source tools and models.
- ***Local Deployment***: Runs on local machines or servers without external dependencies.
- ***RAG System***: Combines retrieval mechanisms with language generation for enhanced responses.
- ***Scalable***: Easily expandable with additional data and models.
- ***Simple UI***: Implements a user-friendly interface using *Streamlit*.

## System Architecture

Below is a block diagram illustrating the system architecture of the *Ollama* Chatbot with a *RAG* system using *ChromaDB*, *FastAPI*, and *Streamlit*:`
